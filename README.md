# GA_Project1_Game

## Project Title (temporary): Flood-It
Based on this game: https://unixpapa.com/floodit/?sz=14&nc=6

### Project concept, game play ideas, designs (sketches/screenshots/wireframes if necessary)
- The game starts as a 14x14 grid, each cell is randomly coloured one of 6 colours.
- The user clicks on any cell in the grid. The colour of the cell is applied to the cell at the top-left and any other cells adjacent to it that are the same colour. 
- Any cells that are adjacent to those recently-coloured cells that are the same colour as the new colour, now are part of the group of cells that will be coloured next time (think of it like the flood paintbucket tool in MS paint).
- The goal is to flood the entire grid in the least number of moves as possible.

### Your MVP (see below for definition of MVP)
- Clicking any cell in the grid turns the "active cells" that colour.

### Other features you plan to implement
